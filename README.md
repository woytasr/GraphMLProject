**Abstract**

This machine learning model is used to predict the outcome of a college basketball game. This is an interesting project because college basketball garners a lot of attention and with that comes a plethora of data. The goal of this project is to find a correlation between high win percentage teams and what team stats going into the game have the largest impact on the outcome. This would be an important project because if the model can predict the outcome of future games with high accuracy, the model could be used to win money through gambling. I hypothesis that the model will predict teams who will win when their most relevant stats are better than their oppenents. I will be able to measure results by using previous season's statistics and iterating through the season, make predictions, and train the model based on the real outcomes of the game. The model compares the correlation between important statistics such as offensive possesion, scoring efficiency, and scoring rate
